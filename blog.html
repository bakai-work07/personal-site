                        <p>After completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I chose not to follow the standard capstone. Instead, 
                            I created my own project to apply data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation skills on a real-world dataset of 
                            top-performing YouTube Shorts. This case study explores what factors  
                            might influence a Short’s virality and viewer engagement.

                        <p>Somehow, I didn’t stop. After getting the sprite moving and walls doing their job, 
                            I thought I’d take a break and maybe touch some grass lol. But instead, I opened good ol' Eclipse and asked myself: 
                            “What if I could pick things up? What if I could open doors? What if I could win?” 
                            And thus began Part 2 of this mildly chaotic game dev journey: object interaction, audio, 
                            and accidentally making a game that’s actually… kind of complete?

                        <a href="posts/2025-07-02.html" class="blog-title">Making a 2D Game in Java #1</a>
                        <p>When I first learned Java in school, I didn’t exactly fall in love with it. 
                            The experience wasn’t helped by the fact that my professor was a bit of a CS purist. He was 
                            obsessed with textbook structure and strict design patterns. We were forced to write rigid, 
                            overly formal code that felt more like academic exercises than anything I actually wanted to build. 
                            I struggled with the syntax, and sometimes I felt like I was just writing code to satisfy a compiler, 
                            not to create something meaningful. But recently, I wanted to make a project I could see come to life:
                             something visual, something I could play. So, I decided to take another shot at Java by building a 2D game.
