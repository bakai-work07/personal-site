        <h1>Making a 2D Game in Java #2</h1>
        <p class="post-date">July 3, 2025</p>
        <p>Somehow, I didn’t stop. After getting the sprite moving and walls doing their job, 
            I thought I’d take a break and maybe touch some grass lol. But instead, I opened good ol' Eclipse and asked myself: 
            “What if I could pick things up? What if I could open doors? What if I could win?” 
            And thus began Part 2 of this mildly chaotic game dev journey: object interaction, audio, 
                and accidentally making a game that’s actually… kind of complete?</p>
        <h2>Adding Interactable Objects</h2>
        <p>The first object I added was a key. Very original, I know. I made a new class for game objects, 
            gave the key a little sprite, and plopped it onto the map. Then I coded a simple check — 
            if the player’s hitbox overlaps the key’s hitbox, hehe YOINK. The key disappears, and the player
            "picks it up". That’s it. One item down! But the inventory system... still nonexistent. Baby steps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, I made a door. Again, revolutionary stuff. The door checks if you have the key, and if you have it, 
            it disappears. No sound yet, but it was still oddly satisfying to watch. 
            I could now pick something up and use it in a different part of the map. Game logic! Progression! A purpose in life! Kinda!

        <h2>Adding Audio (a.k.a. Sounds So I Know I Did a Thing)</h2>
        <p>At some point, I realised picking up keys in complete silence felt weird. Like the game wasn’t 
            acknowledging my greatness. So I added some audio. I made a basic Clip object in Java, loaded a .wav file, 
            and played it when the player picks something up. I also added sound for opening the door — slightly different ding, 
            still primitive, but very satisfying. 
            I even made the game theme audio myself, which was way more painful than it sounds.
            But the game finally felt less like a bunch of rectangles moving around and more 
            like something you’d let your friend try out for 30 seconds before saying “wait it’s not done yet.”
        </p>
        <p>Also yes, I did spend more time trying to make the right ding sound than actually implementing it. 
        </p>

        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <p>With keys and doors working, I added a chest. Just a simple object, 
            sitting at the end of the map. If you reach it, the game prints a victory message. No credits, no fireworks, 
            just a “you win” console line and the quiet satisfaction of knowing I touched a chest and Java didn’t throw a 
            NullPointerException. A true milestone.</p>

        <p>Later on, I made it more dramatic. I added a sound effect, froze the player, and added some words to the screen! 
        It’s still basic, but honestly, it felt like closure. The game now had a beginning (spawn), a middle (key and door), 
        and an end (chest). That’s a full game loop! Kind of!
        </p>

        <h2>Optimizing (a.k.a. Please Don't Melt My Laptop)</h2>
        <p>Now that everything worked, I did what every dev does right after a small win: panic about performance. 
            I scaled all my BufferedImages properly so I wasn’t stretching and blurring things every time I drew them. 
            Turns out scaling once and reusing is slightly better than making your GPU cry every frame. Who knew?
        </p>
        <p>I also added diagonal movement, which sounds simple... but wasn’t. Suddenly my player could move like a normal human being — 
            not just up, down, left, right, but diagonally. This broke collisions for a while and made me question everything I thought 
            I understood about hitboxes. But hey, now you can walk around smoothly like you’re in a real game. Wild.</p>

        <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
        <p>I’m thinking of slowly turning this into a tiny RPG — maybe add dialogue boxes, quests, and a very emotionally unavailable NPC
            who gives you side missions. Nothing too crazy yet, just building up the systems piece by piece.</p>
        <p class="last-paragraph">It’s still not efficient-efficient, but it runs smooth, doesn’t crash, and feels playable. 
            That’s enough for now.</p>
