        <h1>ü™¥The One Where I Made a Plant Doctor</h1>
        <p class="post-date">July 22, 2025</p>
        <p>As part of the Google UX/UI Certificate, I was tasked with designing a mobile app from the ground up. 
            When I saw others design food delivery apps for the millionth time, I decided to build PlantPal. It's
            a smart plant care assistant that diagnoses plant issues and helps users treat them step-by-step. Basically, 
            it‚Äôs like a plant therapist but with less talking.
            This case study walks through my not-so-textbook but very practical design process ‚Äî 
            from defining a problem worth solving to building a clean, interactive prototype that makes plant care a little less intimidating.</p>
        <h2>üß† Empathize + Define: The (Totally Real) Problem</h2>
        <p>Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî most people who buy plants have no idea how to keep them alive. 
            They see a sad brown spot on a leaf, panic, and either overwater it or throw the whole plant away. 
            I wanted to solve that confusion by creating an app that helps people figure out what‚Äôs wrong, guides them through the fix, 
            and keeps them on track without relying on their memory or random Reddit threads.

            <h3>Target users:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Plant owners (novice to casual)</li>

            <li>People who want fast, visual help diagnosing their plant</li>

            <li>Those who forget to follow up on care routines</li>

            <h3>Pain points:</h3>

            <li>Googling symptoms leads to vague or conflicting answers</li>

            <li>Forgetting treatment steps after diagnosis</li>

            <li>No clear tracking or reminders for plant recovery</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2>‚úèÔ∏è Ideate + Lo-fi Wireframes: Skipping the Sketchbook</h2>
        <p>No, I didn‚Äôt do paper wireframes. Sue me. But I did jump straight into digital wireframing, because Figma exists and 
            my handwriting is objectively terrible.

            <h3>Here‚Äôs what I mapped out:</h3>

            <li>A home screen with camera access to scan a plant</li>

            <li>A scanning animation flow to simulate the analysis process</li>

            <li>A diagnosis screen with the plant issue, severity, and helpful visuals</li>

            <li>A step-by-step treatment guide with checkboxes to track progress</li>

            <li>A progress tracker/reminder toggle, because let‚Äôs be real: people forget.</li>

            <li>A plant history log, for the Type-A users who want a care receipt</li>
        </p>

        <h2>üé® Design + Prototype: Making It Pretty (and Functional)</h2>
        <p>After wireframing, I moved into high-fidelity design. I focused on:
            <ul>
            <li>A calm, plant-inspired color palette (think light greens and minimal gradients)</li>

            <li>A friendly yet professional tone (no guilt-tripping plant killers here)></li>

            <li>Clear visual hierarchy with lots of whitespace</li>

            <li>Interactive toggles, checklists, and progress feedback to boost usability</li>

            <li>Subtle emoji usage to guide users without clutter</li>

            <h3>I also designed key microinteractions:</h3>

            <li>A scanning animation that ‚Äúbuilds suspense‚Äù as the app processes</li>

            <li>A dynamic care step checklist with a reminder toggle</li>

            <li>A gentle nudge toward scanning another plant to encourage reuse</li>
        </ul></p>
        <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/HHWdBqJxGoxvVzFH1CLTPH/Low-Fi-Wireframe-for-Plant-App?node-id=35-172&p=f&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=17%3A202&starting-point-node-id=35%3A172&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>    
        
        <h2>üí° Final Thoughts: Growth (Not Just for the Plants)</h2>
        <p>PlantPal was about showcasing how I approach digital product design. Even without the full stack of sticky notes and 
            user personas, I built something useful, cohesive, and intuitive.

            <h3>Through this project, I got to:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Apply design thinking in a fast, practical context</li>

            <li>Practice translating wireframes into interactive mockups</li>

            <li>Focus on user clarity, accessibility, and gentle visual delight</li>

            <li>Build a full mobile UI flow from onboarding to diagnosis to follow-up</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="last-paragraph">I‚Äôd love to take this concept even further (maybe image recognition or AI-based diagnosis next?), 
            but for now, this was my little experiment in blending smart UX with a green thumb.</p>
