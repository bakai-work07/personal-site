        <h1>Breaking Down Viral YouTube Shorts</h1>
        <p class="post-date">July 10, 2025</p>
        <p>After completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I chose not to follow the standard capstone. Instead, 
            I created my own project to apply data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation skills on a real-world dataset of 
            top-performing YouTube Shorts. This case study explores what factors  
            might influence a Short’s virality and viewer engagement.</p>
        <h2>🧼 From Raw to Ready: Cleaning the Dataset</h2>
        <p>The dataset I started with was... not great. View counts were in “K”s and “M”s like it was still 2010. 
            Durations looked like alien code (PT59S?), and timestamps came in full ISO glory with a nice little “Z” at the end. 
            Some rows were missing likes, some had titles in scripts I couldn’t read, and overall, it just felt chaotic.
        </p>
        <img src="images/capstone1/1.webp" alt="messy data">
        <p>
            So, I cleaned the data and scrubbed it HARD, turning the views and likes into proper numbers. I also converted all the cryptic 
            durations into seconds, cleaned up the timestamps and pulled out useful features like day of week and weekday vs weekend. 
            I even added columns of my own — hashtag count, like/view ratios, etc. What started out unreadable became something clean and well-structured.
        </p>
        <img src="images/capstone1/2.webp" alt="clean data">
        <h2>📊 Plotting the Data: Starting with Hashtags</h2>
        <p>Once the data was cleaned, I jumped into plotting. The first thing I wanted to explore was whether more hashtags meant more views. 
            It’s a common belief—more hashtags equals more exposure, right?
            So I plotted a scatterplot of hashtag count vs. view count. And... nothing. No trend, no clear line, no magical hashtag sweet spot. 
            Some Shorts with just one hashtag pulled insane numbers, while others with five or more barely made a dent. Turns out, slapping on 
            more hashtags isn’t the secret to going viral.
        </p>
        <img src="images/capstone1/3.webp" alt="rstudio">
        <p>The takeaway? Hashtags might help with visibility, but they don’t guarantee engagement. You can’t out-hashtag bad content.
        </p>
        <img src="images/capstone1/4.webp" alt="scatterplot">
        <h2>📦 Weekday vs Weekend: Does Timing Matter?</h2>
        <p>Next, I looked at whether the day a Short was uploaded had any effect on engagement. Specifically, I compared the like-to-view ratio 
            between weekdays and weekends using a boxplot.</p>
        <img src="images/capstone1/7.webp" alt="rstudio">    
        <p>The results? Slightly higher engagement on weekdays, but nothing dramatic. Both groups had similar spreads, a few outliers, and plenty of overlap. 
            So while weekday uploads might have a tiny edge, it’s probably not enough to stress over.
        </p>
        <p>Moral of the story: If your content is good, it doesn’t really matter what day you post. If it’s bad, no amount of “posting at the 
            right time” will save it.</p>
        <img src="images/capstone1/8.webp" alt="boxplot">
        <p>To double-check the boxplot results, I also calculated the mean and median like-to-view ratios for each group.</p>
        <img src="images/capstone1/9.webp" alt="rstudio">
        <p>And yep — the numbers back it up.

        Weekdays: mean = 0.047, median = 0.045

        Weekends: mean = 0.046, median = 0.043

        The difference is tiny. Statistically real? Maybe. Practically meaningful? Probably not. Just more proof that content > timing.
        </p>
        <img src="images/capstone1/10.webp" alt="rstudio">
        <h2>📅 Average Views by Day: Does the Day You Post Matter?</h2>
        <p>To dig a little deeper into timing, I broke things down by individual day of the week. 
            I plotted the average views for Shorts posted on each day.
        </p>
        <img src="images/capstone1/11.webp" alt="rstudio">
        <p>The result? Monday absolutely crushed it. Shorts uploaded on Mondays pulled in the highest average views by a mile. Sunday and 
            Tuesday weren’t far behind, but Thursday to Friday? Definitely the quieter end of the week.</p>
        <p>So does the day you post actually matter? Maybe. Or maybe creators just happened to drop bangers on Mondays. Either way, 
            if you're going to experiment with timing, Mondays might not be a bad place to start.
        </p>
        <h2>🧾 Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>This project started as a way to apply what I learned in the Google Data Analytics course, but it ended up being a lot more 
            hands-on than I expected. I had to collect, clean, and reshape a messy dataset, make design decisions on what to measure, 
            and figure out what the numbers actually meant.</p>
        <p class="last-paragraph">Along the way, I learned that data rarely speaks for itself. You have to ask the right questions, 
            test your assumptions, and be okay with answers like “it depends.” Virality is messy, and metrics like views and likes only tell 
            part of the story. But with the right tools and some curiosity, you can still find patterns worth talking about.
        I might try the Advanced Data Analytics cert next — or maybe build something a little bigger, now that I kind of know what I’m doing.</p>
