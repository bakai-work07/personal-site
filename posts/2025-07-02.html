        <h1>Making a 2D Game in Java #1</h1>
        <p class="post-date">July 2, 2025</p>
        <p>I first met Java in school, and letâ€™s just say it wasnâ€™t love at first compile. 
            Our prof was the kind of CS purist who treated design patterns like gospel and 
            thought inheritance was some dangerous forbidden magic. I was strictly told never to use it, 
            like it would summon demons from the JVM!</p>
        <p>But today, I decided to give it another shot â€” not to write the next enterprise-grade framework, 
            but to make something simple and visual. Something that moves. 
            Something I can actually play. So Iâ€™m building a 2D game, and this time, Iâ€™m using Java to bring a little
            sprite to life on my screen. </p>
        <img src="images/post1.webp" alt="picture of pixel art">
        <h2>Making a sprite move</h2>
        <p>The first milestone was simple: getting a sprite
            to move around with arrow keys. I created a basic game loop using a JPanel, 
            set up key listeners, and tracked the playerâ€™s X and Y position.
            I started with a white rectangle, then I added my own custom sprite!

        <h2>Adding textures to the game</h2>
        <p>Now that I had that going, I wanted to add actual textures to the background. I went to Piskel and whipped up some
            custom textures, and added them to the game! At first, I only added grass, water, and stone â€” I didn't want to make
            anything too fancy lol. The harder part was learning how to implement a tile system â€” it took me a lot of debugging,
            and it was always some missing symbol or an accidental typo that caused the whole thing to go haywire. Eventually, I managed to do this:

        <h2>Implementing Collision</h2>
        <p>With textures in place, I ran into my next challenge: walking through walls. Not very immersive. 
            So I started implementing basic collision detection. I gave certain tiles a collision property, 
            and added a hitbox to my sprite. Then, I checked for overlap before allowing movement in any direction.</p>
        <p>This part was trickier than I thought. I wasn't careful with the spriteâ€™s hitbox while I was making sure 
            it was aligned with the tile grid properly. At one point, I kept colliding with invisible air â€” 
            turns out I was rendering my player in the wrong area...  ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

        <h2>Whatâ€™s Next?</h2>
        <p>Right now, Iâ€™ve got a little character moving around a basic tiled world, 
            unable to walk through walls. And honestly, Iâ€™m proud of it. Thereâ€™s still so much I want to learn â€” animation
             frames, enemy AI, maybe even items and inventory systems. But for the first time, Iâ€™m enjoying writing Java.
