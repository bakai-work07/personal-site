# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal website, built from scratch using HTML and CSS.

The site includes a short personal intro, my current skillset, and a blog section where I’ll showcase projects and experiments over time.

It’s still a work in progress — I’ll continue refining the design, adding content, and learning as I go.
